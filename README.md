## Hey there 👋🏾

The name is Johnson Mwakazi — a software engineer, web and mobile developer, and lifelong learner based in Nairobi, Kenya 🇰🇪.

With 5+ years of experience in the world of web and mobile development, I have grown from building responsive interfaces to leading high-performance applications across fintech, e-commerce, and startups.

🔍 **A little about me...**

I started off building simple web pages — learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and bringing designs to life. As I explored deeper into modern frameworks and scalable architectures, I discovered my love for crafting seamless user experiences. Fast-forward to today, I'm:

* 💻 Building and deploying high-performance web and mobile applications using React, Next.js, and React Native
* 🔒 Implementing secure authentication flows, SSR optimization, and cross-domain communication
* 🚀 Exploring modern backend technologies, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud deployment strategies
* 🌍 Collaborating on open-source projects and mentoring upcoming developers in the tech community

🧪 Lately into...

These days you'll find me deep into modern web architectures, AI, and prompt engineering, crafting seamless applications using Next.js, TypeScript, React Native, and LLMs. Whether it's building a personal project aimed at solving real challenges across Africa or optimizing performance for large-scale applications — I'm always building something fun and practical.
